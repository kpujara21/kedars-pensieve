            <p>What I'm going to be diving into is my bold take on the relationship between our mind and body. It's quite an abstract topic, so I'll try to articulate my thoughts as best as I can :) </p>

            <p>I perceive the mind and the body are two separate entities. At birth, we were presented with this body for our soul to inhibit. This body was created with many predispositions to certain traits and qualities, largely bounded by our genetics. It serves as a baseline for the capabilities and personality for this human body. 

            <p>Now how does our mind come into play. I don’t believe our mind is a clean slate to begin with, but when it comes to its knowledge regarding the body it is housed in, I do believe it starts from ground zero. Through the course of our lives, our mind gradually gains a better understanding of our body. From learning which foods and activities it finds pleasure in to which sleep schedules it performs best under to its physical activities, we are constantly learning more and more about the intricacies of the human body. The mind is constantly registering and learning from what our bodies accept and reject and with a “happy body, happy mind” mentality, will strive towards keeping the body satisfied.</p>
            
            <p>It can be a little confusing to describe how I envision it, but here is an analogy that may better capture my thoughts. I picture the human body as a complex instrument and the soul as a musician. At birth, the soul has never picked up this instrument before. Gradually, with time and effort the soul becomes more adequate in handling this intricate instrument. It may never become a master, but it is about the journey, not the destination. </p>
            
            <p>This is very abstract thinking, so let me bring it back to myself. I’ve been alive for 23 years, almost 24 years old. I think I am at a point where I can reflect on my personal journey and how my soul has reached the point it is right now. Here is what I have learned about myself. This is pretty personal, but I am using this as a medium to note where I am at this point in my life. Who knows, I may be a totally different person down the road. I will refer to my body in the third person and my soul in the first. </p>
            
            <p> Since a young age, Kedar has expressed a delicate fondness of the world and nature, which is why I send positive feedback looks whenever he goes hiking and sees beautiful views. I have come to know that he would much rather be a night owl than an early riser as I notice his productivity is much higher in the evening over an early morning. When it comes to food, he has a very strong sweet tooth and affinity for spices and a strong disdain for mushrooms. The mind can take in information and process it to help adjust the body’s taste and preferences </p> 
            
            <p>I’m not sure how much sense that made and I’m not sure how much I believe this, but it seemed like a cool concept at the time. Either that, or it might’ve just been the lack of sleep at the time. Either way, hope you enjoyed. Reach out if you’d like to discuss about this or anything else! </p>
