            <p>Subjectivity is such a crucial part of what makes us human, opinions and tastes. It’s what makes us unique and think differently. We can have talent shows and cooking shows where the winners are selected based on the opinion of the judges. If I lose a cook-off at my local farmer’s market (the judge was rigged), it’s probably not the end of the world. But the ramifications of certain cases of subjectivity can be a lot more severe, and in this article I’m going to be discussing the subjectivity of intent and its part in our lives as humans.</p>

            <p>The importance of intent in modern society is so incredible. Whether we’re focusing on criminal law, or hurting someone’s feelings, our perception of a given situation is largely affected by the motives that drove the event. </p>
            
            <p>If that judge at my local cook-off really drilled down on how bad my cooking was, he could potentially have two different intentions: one to berate me and one for genuine positive criticism so I can do better next time. My reaction would be polar opposites depending on my best gauge on what his motives were. </p>
            
            <p>Let’s look at a couple more serious examples that deal with criminal intent.</p>
            
            <p>For our first example, let’s say a man has a gun and he is headed home to go kill his wife. His wife is taking a shower and when he reaches the bathroom, she gets frightened, trips and falls. She is unconscious and is bleeding profusely. The man chooses not to help her and she bleeds to death. </p>
            
            <p>Now let’s look at a second example. A man suffers a seizure while driving in the car. He loses control and runs over and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk. This man has no history of a seizure or a criminal record. </p>
            
            <p>Now, in these sitiations, do we charge these men for murder? Do we assess the situation based on intent or purely the consequence. In the first scenario, we know the husband intended to kill the wife, but the outcome was that she died without the man pulling the trigger or even making contact with her physically. In the second scenario, the man had absolutely no intention of killing the pedestrian, however the outcome was that he objectively committed manslaughter. </p>
            
            <p>In both of these hypothetical scenarios, we have a person that has killed another person. If we determined the law based off intent, we would have to arrest the man in the first example and the man in the second example would be deemed innocent. On the contrary, if the law was determined purely based on the consequence of the event, the first man would be free and the second one would be labeled a criminal. </p>
            
            <p>I brought up extreme situations just to make a point, but a profuse number of cases lie between these two extremes on the spectrum of cases determined by criminal intent. Criminal intent is referred to as “mens rea,” which translates to an individual’s state of mind at the time he committed a crime. It can be classified as one of the following: purposeful, knowing, reckless, and negligent. </p>
            
            <p>The reason I really wanted to write about the topic of intention is because I find it baffling how much of our psyche determines how we feel about a situation based on the intent behind it. Throughout all these years in education, we are taught to be objective in our reasoning. But when it comes to real life situations, we often have to throw objectivity out the window and assess a situation largely based on the person’s intentions behind their actions. </p>
            
            <p>But we can’t even measure intention! And we pretty much never will be able to. We can never know what is going on in someone else’s mind. How can we ever say for certain what a person’s intention or motivation is behind any person’s actions. Although we are developed within this realm with many tools for understanding human behavior, we can never know for certain. Yet why do we rely so much behind another human’s intention when evaluating a given situation? </p>
            
            <p>The reason I’m so conflicted I’m on the matter is because the consequences can be painstakingly high. Incorrectly judging situations from intent leads to innocent humans landing jail time or a ticket to death row and we hear many cases of these situations every year.</p>
            
             <p>I don’t know the answer to this problem, but I’m curious on what other people have to say on the matter. If you have a perspective on this topic I would love to hear your thoughts. Just reach out to me via email at kedarpujara@gmail.com and I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
